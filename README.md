# PNN_LPP
A Probabilistic Nearest Neighbors Based Locality Preserving Projections

Dimensionality reduction based unsupervised metric learning consists in finding meaningful compact data representations previously to clustering and classification problems. One of the major aspects of these algorithms is the approximation of the underlying manifold by a weighted graph. In this paper, we propose to improve the Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) algorithm by incorporating a recently proposed graph inference method called Probabilistic Nearest Neighbors (PNN), an extension of the Clustering with Adaptive Neighbors (CAN) approach, used with success in graph-based semi-supervised learning. The proposed PNN-LPP algorithm is able to achieve better classification results than regular LPP, showing competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches for dimensionality reduction, such as the UMAP algorithm.
